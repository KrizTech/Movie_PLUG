## The Story

First, We are inspired by the complex and excruciating processes of getting to find a movie of your choice to stream, be it alone, with friends or family. The search is over. Movieplug is a platform that makes it easy of anyone at anytime to access any movie of their choice generated by an AI or searched for manually. 

That is why we are Your surest MoviePlug!

A workspace was created on Trello which was utilized throughout in order to keep tasks and communication organized.
The javascript front end and the way the dashboard was designed, allowed MoviePlug to have more dynamic features and experience.

The RapidAPI was implemented to enable users search for movies by typing a keyword
We decided to use ORM and MySQL because of modularity and familiarity.

FrontEnd
* Javascript components
* HTML/CSS for consistent styling
* Calls to manipulate database

RapidAPI
* GET, POST, PUT requests handled.

Relational Database
* Handled with ORM (SQLAlchemy)
* Model system with base model handling identification

## Future

There are plenty of features that we would love to implement into MoviePlug.
One of the MoviePlug standby mission is inclusivity, Making the platform accessible to everybody at anytime and anywhere. MoviePlug in future wil be adding subtitle opions, audio tracks, downloading features to the web app, where anyone can download movies easily. Making art and story telling accessible to all. In other to achieve this, It is recommended to use specialized APIs, equipped servers, frameworks and libraries to ensure a robust and secure implementation and experience.
